# Leia LumePad 3D Tablet

This folder has a Windows 10 batch file script, make4v.bat, that runs Image Magick to create a _2x2 image for the Lumepad.
The batch file creates a 3D image from four images captured with four NX2000 cameras controlled by MultiNX.
The four images were aligned with Stereo Photo Maker before using the script.
